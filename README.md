# Battleship Game

This project is a classic **Battleship** game written in C++. The game is played on a terminal, where players strategically place and attack ships on a grid to sink their opponent's fleet.

## Features

- **Terminal-Based Gameplay**: The game grid is fully drawn on the terminal, providing a text-based interface for placing ships and making attacks.
- **Single-Player Mode**: Players can play against a computer opponent that randomly places its ships and responds to player moves.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two players to take turns placing ships and attacking each other's grid. Players can compete head-to-head, with each player taking a turn on the same terminal to sink their opponent's fleet. 
- **Grid Customization**: The grid allows players to place ships in various positions and orientations, following traditional Battleship rules.
